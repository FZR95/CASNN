# CASNN: Continuous Adaptive SNN for HAR

> *Abstract*—Human activity recognition (HAR) is an application of great importance in the Internet of Things (IoT). Inertial measurement units (IMU) on wearable devices provide the primary source of time-series data for HAR. In this paper, we focus on addressing the energy consumption and performance issues in real-world scenarios for continuous HAR using time-series signals. We present a continuous adaptive SNN (CASNN) suitable for low-power wearable devices. CASNN is implemented by introducing early exit into SNN, and the early exit branches do not require additional classifiers. The results show that CASNN can reduce up to 56% FLOPs and improve more than 5% accuracy with additional cross-person generalization capabilities on the continuous HAR dataset.

We are currently in the process of tidying up the repository, the code will be presented ASAP.
